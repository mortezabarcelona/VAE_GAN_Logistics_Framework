# VAE-GAN Logistics Framework 

This project implements a hybrid **VAE-GAN (Variational Autoencoder - Generative Adversarial Network)** architecture for intelligent logistics scenario generation and optimization. It simulates and evaluates multi-modal, dynamic supply chains under various real-world conditions such as disruptions, sustainability constraints, and high demand.
